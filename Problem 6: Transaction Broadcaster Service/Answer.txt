Architecture Design

The transaction broadcaster service can be designed as a microservice with the following architecture:

1. Internal API: This acts as the entry point of the service and communicates with other services within the organization. It exposes a RESTful endpoint broadcast_transaction which takes the message_type and data as inputs in the request payload. The internal API validates the input and forwards the request to the Transaction Processor component.
2. Transaction Processor: This component is responsible for processing the incoming transactions and preparing them for broadcast. It performs the following tasks:
    - Validates the input parameters received from the internal API.
    - Signs the data using the private key of the broadcaster service.
    - Adds the signed transaction to a queue for broadcast.
3. Queue: This component acts as a buffer to store the signed transactions that are waiting to be broadcasted. The queue ensures that the transactions are broadcasted in the order they were received and provides resiliency against failures.
4. Transaction Broadcaster: This component is responsible for broadcasting the signed transactions to the blockchain network. It performs the following tasks:
    - Picks a transaction from the queue.
    - Makes a RPC request to the blockchain node to broadcast the signed transaction.
    - If the broadcast is successful, it marks the transaction as successful and removes it from the queue.
    - If the broadcast fails, it retries the broadcast after a certain interval. The retry mechanism should be designed in such a way that it does not cause the blockchain network to be overwhelmed.
    - If the broadcast continues to fail even after multiple retries, the transaction is marked as failed and removed from the queue.
5. Monitoring Dashboard: This component provides an interface for the admin to monitor the status of the transactions. The dashboard should display the following information:
    - List of all transactions that have been broadcasted.
    - The status of each transaction (successful or failed).
    - The number of retries for each failed transaction.
    - An option for the admin to manually retry a failed transaction.

Implementation Details

1. Internal API: The internal API can be implemented using a popular web framework such as Flask or Django. The API should validate the input parameters and return appropriate HTTP status codes in case of any errors.
2. Transaction Processor: The transaction processor can be implemented using a worker process that runs in the background. The worker can be implemented using a task queue such as Celery or RabbitMQ. The worker should validate the input parameters and sign the transaction before adding it to the queue for broadcast.
3. Queue: A message queue such as RabbitMQ can be used to store the signed transactions. The message queue should be highly available and provide resiliency against failures.
4. Transaction Broadcaster: The transaction broadcaster can be implemented using a worker process that runs in the background. The worker can be implemented using a task queue such as Celery or RabbitMQ. The worker should pick a transaction from the queue, broadcast it to the blockchain network, and mark it as successful or failed based on the response from the blockchain network. If the broadcast fails, the worker should retry the broadcast after a certain interval. The retry mechanism can be implemented using exponential backoff.
5. Monitoring Dashboard: The monitoring dashboard can be implemented using a web-based framework such as Flask or Django. The dashboard should use a database such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB to store the transaction information and display it to the admin in real-time. The dashboard should be secure and should require authentication for access.

Performance Considerations

1. Load Balancing: To handle a large number of incoming requests, the internal API can be load balanced using a popular load balancer such as Nginx or HAProxy. The load balancer should distribute the requests evenly across multiple instances of the internal API to ensure that the service remains highly available.
2. Scaling: The transaction broadcaster service should be designed to handle a large number of transactions per second. To achieve this, the service can be scaled horizontally by running multiple instances of the Transaction Processor and Transaction Broadcaster components. The message queue should be designed to handle a high volume of messages and provide high throughput.
3. Caching: To improve the performance of the service, caching can be used to store frequently accessed data in memory. A popular caching solution such as Redis or Memcached can be used to implement caching.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the transaction broadcaster service can be designed as a microservice that consists of several components such as the internal API, transaction processor, queue, transaction broadcaster, and monitoring dashboard. The service should be designed to handle a large number of transactions per second and provide high availability and resiliency against failures. The service should also be scalable and designed to handle a large volume of messages.
